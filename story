"The castle sat on a hill. While it was easy to see, no one could reach it. I know becuase Ive been stuck here alone for six years. I tried to escape once, but I was (obviously) unsuccessful. The oddest part of my current situation is that while there are no other people around, something is keeping me here. When I try to leave, I end up back in the throne room, staring out the window at the mountains beyond the valley."
